# project brief

this project is going to serve as the basis for a blog post,
and a professional portfolio item in the context of AI, LLMs, NLP 
and specifically and importantly, RAG.

The goal is to showcase different RAG technologies and compare them in an interactive manner.
The vision is to have an interactive website where the user can ask questions about a text
(a well known text like The Lord of the Rings, but also maybe texts from othe doamains) 
and we will use different RAG technologies and compare different metrics 
about the answer (relevance, truthfulness, completeness, performance).

I want to compare:

- different embeddings (ada, text-small, text-large, voyage) for the vector database
- using a knowledge graph in addition to the vector database
  - what entity resoltion technique to use (and compare them)
  - clustering and communities
- query enhancement (with and without, and techniques)


The website should be interactive and visual and easy to use
Questions should be pre-populated so the user does not have to type

There should be examples showcasing the strength of different methods,
like a more complex question spanning multiple layers of entities
that is very well answered by a knowledge graph RAG but cannot be 
answered by a naive vector-only RAG.
